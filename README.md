# Task Master
A simple To-Do list app (CRUD) made with Flask (Python).
<br><br>
Flask is a micro web framework written in Python. It is classified as a microframework because it does not require particular tools or libraries.It has no database abstraction layer, form validation, or any other components where pre-existing third-party libraries provide common functions.

## Prerequisites
Make sure you have `python` and `pip` installed

## How To Run
1. Install `virtualenv`, which will allows you to create a virtual environment for the project:
```
$ pip install virtualenv
```

2. Open a terminal in the project root directory and run:
```
$ virtualenv env
```

3. Then run the command:
```
$ .\env\Scripts\activate
```

4. Then install the dependencies:
```
$ (env) pip install -r requirements.txt
```

5. Finally start the web server:
```
$ (env) python3 app.py
```

This server will start on port 5000 by default. You can change this in `app.py` by changing the following line to this:

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(debug=True, port=<desired port>)
```
